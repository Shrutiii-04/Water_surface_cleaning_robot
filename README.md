# Autonomous Water Surface Cleaning Robot

## Project Overview:

The Water Surface Cleaning Robot is an autonomous/semi-autonomous robotic system designed to remove floating waste such as plastic, leaves, and debris from water bodies including lakes, ponds, rivers, and reservoirs. The project aims to reduce water pollution while minimizing human effort and risk.
This robot operates on the water surface using a propulsion system and a waste collection mechanism, making it suitable for environmental monitoring and cleaning applications.
